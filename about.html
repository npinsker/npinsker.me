<div class="section-header">About me</div>

<p>Hi! I'm Nathan. I'm currently working on Galactic Diner full-time.</p>

<p>My favorite kind of work is looking to "surprise and delight" in a game &mdash; from intricate gameplay systems that create depth, to little aesthetic touches that people might hardly notice.</p>

<p>I also enjoy teaching, cooking, running, watching anime and movies, trying to learn to draw, and trying new restaurants. I used to play the violin and still try to pick it up occasionally. I also organize <a href="/puzzles">puzzle hunts</a> with my friends, though I'm less active with that these days.</p>

<p>Catch me on <a href="http://twitter.com/npinsker">Twitter</a> if you want to say hi!</p>
