<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>In 2020, I helped write and run the 2021 MIT Mystery Hunt with my team, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">✈️✈️✈️ Galactic Trendsetters ✈️✈️✈️.</span> Mystery Hunt is the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_hunt">puzzle hunt</a> in the world. The event is normally run on MIT's campus, but was held online that year because of the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>As the focus of our event, we built an MMO called the <b>Projection Device</b>. We aimed to increase the social nature of the hunt and to add fresh ideas to many other parts of the event. Building an MMO for thousands of players was an enormous gamble for many reasons, but I think it ended up paying off and we achieved our goals.</p>

<p>The Projection Device is an isometric multiplayer online game set at ⊥IW, an alternate version of MIT. Players can walk around a reproduction of ⊥IW's campus and interact with objects and people. All players share the same world and can see each other.</p>

<p>Check it out <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2021/projection_device.html">here</a>!</p>

<h3>How did it work?</h3>

<p>During the event, teams were initially given a small area to explore. As they explored, they would unlock puzzles. Solving puzzles would progress the story, unlocking more areas of campus with new puzzles to find.</p>

<p>Throughout the weekend, players could see one another. Thousands of players explored the Projection Device over the weekend, even reaching 1,200 concurrent players at peak.</p>

<p>We prepared lots of fun surprises for our players, and they also created stories of their own. Flip through the images below to see some highlights!</p>

<h3>Anything fun I can do?</h3>

<p>Yes! Other than exploring, here are some approachable puzzles you can try:</p>

<p><b>Fishing:</b> There are 5 hidden fishing spots around campus (one is in a building basement). See how many different fish you can catch. Watch out: there's a different trick to every pond!</p>

<p><b>Sphinx:</b> Go to the Student Center (use fast travel), talk to the sphinx, and try to solve its riddles.</p>

<p><b>Egg Hunt:</b> Go to the Athletics Field (southwest corner of the map; use fast travel) and see if you can find all 60 hidden eggs.</p>
